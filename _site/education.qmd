# Education 

## Master in Data Science - University of British Columbia (September 2024 - June 2025)

I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University of British Columbia, driven by my passion for statistics and machine learning. I was drawn to this program because of my strong interest in solving complex real-world problems using data-driven insights—particularly in healthcare and finance.

I have a deep curiosity for mathematical concepts and their interdisciplinary applications, and this program has allowed me to refine my skills in:

- Programming: Python, R
- Data Engineering: SQL, version control (Git)
- Machine Learning: Supervised learning, algorithms & data structures
- Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statistical Foundations: Experimental design, hypothesis testing, probability

Throughout the program, I’ve worked on collaborative projects, applying these skills to real-world datasets. You can find more details on my Projects page. Additionally, I will be working on a capstone project with an industry partner to tackle a real-world business challenge using data science.



## Bachelor's in Biomedical Sciences - Trent University (September 2020 - April 2024)

I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences with a Minor in Mathematics at Trent University. My academic journey was shaped by my dual passion for biology and mathematics, which led me to a degree that merges both disciplines.
