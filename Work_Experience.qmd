# Work Experience 

## Dental Assistant

During my fourth year, I got the pleasure to take part in a co-op course to get hands-on experience working in the health care field. I worked as a dental assistent at Park Street Dentsitry. It was an amazing experience! I got to be at the forefront of care. I met indivduals from different walks of life. Addicts recovering from a drug addiction trying to turn their life around by taking out rotten teeth destroyed from years of drug abuse  where I was able to emotionally assist by talking through the proccess and calming them down. to young syrian refugee families that have never seen a health care proffesional who I had to translate for because they couldn't speak english. I developed several skills like care taking, empathy patience, and team work. Additionally, I was able to see all the behind the scenes action that most people don't get to see and the hard work that all the assistants and technicians do that goes unnoticed. I learned about the importance of cleanlines and blah blah in health care. These are skills that I can bring into the tech field. 

## Lab Technichian Assistant

Additionally, in third year I got to be a lab technician assistant. Add what I did, what I learned, and how i can contribute this to data science.
