I independently designed and conducted a full experiment — from forming a research question to analyzing the results using R — applying both experimental methods and statistical modeling to evaluate the effectiveness of natural antibiotics.\n\n\nProject Goals & Contributions\n\nDesigned the entire experimental setup including controls, treatments, and randomized testing\nCollected and cultured bacterial samples from real biological sources\nPrepared varying concentrations (0%, 50%, 100%) of honey and tea tree oil\nControlled environmental conditions across two locations (bedroom and basement)\nPerformed bacterial colony counting (CFU) and logged observations across 24 test samples\nWrote and executed R code for data wrangling, model fitting, ANOVA, interaction plots, and residual diagnostics\nUsed lm() models, contrasts, and Tukey tests to assess significance of location, antibiotic, and concentration\n\n\n\n\nTechnical and Scientific Implementation\n\nR (base, gmodels) for modeling, plotting, and contrast analysis\n\nExperimental Design principles (randomization, controls, blocks)\n\nData Wrangling and exploratory data visualization\n\nHypothesis Testing & Interpretation using ANOVA and linear models\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nApplied real-world data science methods to a biology problem from scratch\nPracticed designing reproducible experiments and manually collecting primary data\nDeveloped comfort with statistical modeling, including multi-factor ANOVA and model diagnostics\nStrengthened skills in scientific writing, research methodology, and R scripting\n\nWhile results did not find statistically significant differences between treatments, this project deepened my understanding of experimental variability, data limitations, and the value of a clear, reproducible workflow. It showcased my ability to design, execute, and interpret full-stack analytical work — a skill I bring to all my data science projects.\n\nFinal Report\n\n\n⬅ Back to Projects"
