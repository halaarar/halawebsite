## Overview

The **NYPD Arrest Tracker App** is a **collaborative data science project** aimed at providing **NYC government executives** with a **unified dashboard** for monitoring **arrest statistics** across the city. 

The goal of this project was to create an **interactive and data-driven tool** that allows policymakers to **track trends, analyze arrest data, and make evidence-based decisions** regarding law enforcement and public safety initiatives.

---

## Project Goals & Contributions

This project was designed to address the challenges of inconsistent, redundant, and fragmented arrest data across various NYC departments. Our solution provides a centralized and interactive dashboard that allows policymakers to:

- **Monitor Trends** – Track the evolution of arrest rates across different crime types, demographics, and locations.
- **Enhance Decision-Making** – Use data-driven insights to inform policy changes and resource allocation.
- **Optimize Law Enforcement Initiatives** – Measure the effectiveness of public safety campaigns.
- **Improve Data Accessibility** – Consolidate arrest statistics into a single, intuitive visualization tool.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing & Engineering
- **Cleaned and structured** arrest data for efficient visualization.
- **Handled missing values and standardized variables** for accuracy.
- **Optimized data formats** for interactive dashboard integration.

### Dashboard Development
- **Built interactive visualizations** using Plotly & Dash.
- **Implemented data filtering** to allow customized user analysis.
- **Optimized map rendering** for smooth, real-time exploration.

### Deployment & UI/UX
- **Containerized dashboard using Docker** for seamless deployment.
- **Designed user-friendly navigation** for intuitive decision-making.


## App Sketch & Design

The dashboard consists of:

- **Interactive NYC Map** – Displays precinct-level arrest data.  
- **Bar Chart** – Visualizes crime frequency with drill-down capabilities.  
- **Time-Series Density Plot** – Tracks arrest trends across time.  
- **Pie Charts** – Show arrest distributions by age and gender.  
- **Sidebar** – Allows filtering by date, location, and crime type.  

This structured design ensures fast and intuitive exploration of arrest trends.



## Key Takeaways & Impact
Through this project, I gained experience in:

- **Data Engineering** – Processing large-scale NYC arrest records.
- **Data Visualization** – Developing interactive dashboards for government use.
- **Policy Analytics** – Using data science to drive public safety decisions.
- **Public Sector UI/UX** – Creating user-friendly tools for non-technical stakeholders.

This project highlights the real-world impact of data science in law enforcement and public policy.
