## Overview

This self-led experimental project explored the antibacterial properties of honey and tea tree oil against gram-negative bacteria. I independently designed and conducted a full experiment — from forming a research question to analyzing the results using R — applying both experimental methods and statistical modeling to evaluate the effectiveness of natural antibiotics.

### Project Goals & Contributions

- Designed the entire experimental setup including controls, treatments, and randomized testing
- Collected and cultured bacterial samples from real biological sources
- Prepared varying concentrations (0%, 50%, 100%) of honey and tea tree oil
- Controlled environmental conditions across two locations (bedroom and basement)
- Performed bacterial colony counting (CFU) and logged observations across 24 test samples
- Wrote and executed R code for data wrangling, model fitting, ANOVA, interaction plots, and residual diagnostics
- Used `lm()` models, contrasts, and Tukey tests to assess significance of location, antibiotic, and concentration

### Technical and Scientific Implementation 

- R (base, gmodels) for modeling, plotting, and contrast analysis  
- Experimental Design principles (randomization, controls, blocks)  
- Data Wrangling and exploratory data visualization  
- Hypothesis Testing & Interpretation using ANOVA and linear models
---

### Key Takeaways

- Applied real-world data science methods to a biology problem from scratch
- Practiced designing reproducible experiments and manually collecting primary data
- Developed comfort with statistical modeling, including multi-factor ANOVA and model diagnostics
- Strengthened skills in scientific writing, research methodology, and R scripting


While results did not find statistically significant differences between treatments, this project deepened my understanding of experimental variability, data limitations, and the value of a clear, reproducible workflow. It showcased my ability to design, execute, and interpret full-stack analytical work — a skill I bring to all my data science projects.
