About Me
I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and moved to Canada when I was 11 years old. I spent a year in Ottawa before settling in Peterborough, ON, where I completed middle school, high school at Crestwood Secondary School, and my undergraduate degree at Trent University.

In August 2025, I moved to Vancouver to pursue my Master’s in Data Science at UBC, and I’ve been loving it so far! The mountains, ocean, and active lifestyle make it an amazing place to live, and I’ve been taking full advantage of everything the city has to offer.

I’m bilingual in English and Arabic, and outside of data science and healthcare, I have a wide range of interests—from outdoor adventures and fitness to creative hobbies and literature.

# Personal Interests: 

## Ski!

Skiing has been one of my biggest passions since I was 13 years old. I joined my high school ski club and even spent a season ski racing, pushing myself to master high-speed turns and technical courses.

Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to ski at Mont Tremblant, Blue Mountain, and various resorts across Canada. Now that I live in Vancouver, I’ve been enjoying the slopes at Cypress and Grouse Mountain, and I’m looking forward to exploring Whistler and other major resorts in BC.

## Weight lifting

I've always been passionate about strength, endurance, and overall health. I started weightlifting in my first year of undergrad, and it quickly became a core part of my routine.

What I love most about lifting is the progress tracking, discipline, and resilience it builds—similar to data science, where continuous improvement and optimization are key. I focus on progressive overload training, mobility work, and functional strength to stay active and push my limits.


## Reading 

Books have always been an escape and a source of knowledge for me. I’ve been an avid reader my whole life, always looking to explore new ideas, different worlds, and unique perspectives.

I enjoy a mix of fiction and nonfiction, with a particular love for:
✔ Sci-fi & Fantasy – Exploring futuristic worlds & deep storytelling
✔ Psychology & Philosophy – Understanding human nature & decision-making
✔ Finance & Investing – Learning about markets, stocks, and wealth-building


## Sewing 

In high school, I took a sewing course where I made a pencil case, pillowcase, and even some clothing items. Since then, I’ve expanded into knitting, crocheting, and DIY fashion projects.

I even invested in my own sewing machine, and while I’d love to work on new projects, I mostly find myself fixing my teenage siblings' clothes instead!

This hobby has taught me attention to detail, problem-solving, and creativity, skills that surprisingly overlap with coding and data science in many ways!


## Fishing 

One summer, I took a leap outside my comfort zone and worked at a fishing and hunting camp—an experience that completely changed my perspective on the outdoors.

Despite growing up a city girl, I found myself learning to fish, shoot, track animals, and navigate the wilderness. Not only did I teach others how to fish, but I also managed to catch the biggest fish in the pond that season!

This experience taught me resilience, patience, and adaptability—qualities that I now apply in problem-solving and tackling complex challenges in data science.


Cooking & Baking
Cooking has always been more than just a necessity for me—it’s a creative outlet and a way to unwind. I love experimenting with new recipes, different cuisines, and unique flavor combinations. Whether it's perfecting a classic homemade pasta dish, trying my hand at Middle Eastern desserts, or recreating my grandmother’s traditional recipes, I find joy in the process of creating something from scratch.

Baking, on the other hand, has taught me precision and patience—qualities that also translate well into data science and programming. Unlike cooking, where you can improvise, baking requires exact measurements and a deep understanding of chemistry, just like fine-tuning machine learning models for optimal performance.

Some of my favorite things to make:
🥘 Cooking: Mediterranean & Middle Eastern dishes, Thai curries, homemade dumplings
🍰 Baking: Cinnamon rolls, cheesecakes, artisan bread


Finance & Investing
I've always been fascinated by finance and investing, and over the years, I’ve taken a personal interest in learning about markets, financial planning, and wealth-building strategies. I actively follow market trends, invest in stocks, ETFs, and GICs, and constantly look for ways to grow my financial literacy.

What I love most about investing is how it mirrors data science—it’s all about analyzing trends, making data-driven decisions, and optimizing strategies for long-term gains. I enjoy breaking down financial concepts, tracking market performance, and making informed investment choices based on data and economic indicators.

Some areas I focus on:
📈 Stock Market Analysis – Tracking and understanding stock trends
🏠 Real Estate Investing – Exploring investment properties and passive income strategies
📊 Portfolio Optimization – Balancing risk vs. return using data-driven decisions
💳 Personal Finance – Budgeting, saving, and maximizing financial opportunities

I believe financial literacy is one of the most important skills to develop, and I enjoy sharing what I’ve learned with others.

Badminton
Badminton has been one of my favorite ways to stay active, competitive, and challenge myself. I love how the sport requires agility, quick decision-making, and strategy, making it a perfect combination of physical and mental engagement.

I play regularly with friends and enjoy both singles and doubles matches. One of the things I love most about the sport is its fast-paced nature, which keeps me sharp and constantly improving my reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and endurance.

🏆 What I’ve gained from badminton:
✔ Strategic thinking – Every shot requires precision and planning, much like structuring a data science project.
✔ Endurance & agility – Quick reactions and adaptability are key—similar to troubleshooting errors in coding!
✔ Competitive mindset – I love pushing myself to improve my skills and strategies with every game.

I’d love to play more tournaments in the future and continue refining my skills on the court!
