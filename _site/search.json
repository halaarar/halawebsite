I’ve always loved problem-solving—the kind of deep, immersive puzzles that demand focus, logic, and persistence. There’s a rush that comes with solving complex problems, and I don’t rest until I find the answer.\nAs I progressed through my undergraduate studies, I decided to pursue a minor in mathematics purely out of passion. I became particularly drawn to statistics and its ability to uncover insights, drive decision-making, and shape the world around us. The power of data and machine learning in advancing society fascinated me, and that’s when I knew I wanted to pursue a Master’s in Data Science.\nNow, I want to leverage AI and machine learning in healthcare, combining my backgrounds in biomedical sciences, mathematics, and data science to drive innovation in the field. Having worked firsthand in healthcare, I’ve seen the impact that better predictive models, data-driven decisions, and automation can have on patient outcomes. Whether it’s enhancing diagnostics, optimizing treatments, or improving operational efficiency, I’m excited to contribute to the future of data-driven healthcare solutions.\nI was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and moved to Canada when I was 11 years old. I spent a year in Ottawa before settling in Peterborough, ON, where I completed middle school, high school at Crestwood Secondary School, and my undergraduate degree at Trent University.\nIn August 2025, I moved to Vancouver to pursue my Master’s in Data Science at UBC, and I’ve been loving it so far! The mountains, ocean, and active lifestyle make it an amazing place to live, and I’ve been taking full advantage of everything the city has to offer.\nI’m bilingual in English and Arabic, and outside of data science and healthcare, I have a wide range of interests—from outdoor adventures and fitness to creative hobbies and literature."

Not only did I teach others how to fish, but I also managed to catch the biggest fish in the pond that season!\n📸 Photo of my biggest catch!\nThis experience taught me resilience, patience, and adaptability—qualities that I now apply in problem-solving and tackling complex challenges in data science.\nCooking & Baking Cooking has always been more than just a necessity for me—it’s a creative outlet and a way to unwind. I love experimenting with new recipes, different cuisines, and unique flavor combinations. Whether it’s perfecting a classic homemade pasta dish, trying my hand at Middle Eastern desserts, or recreating my grandmother’s traditional recipes, I find joy in the process of creating something from scratch.\nBaking, on the other hand, has taught me precision and patience—qualities that also translate well into data science and programming. Unlike cooking, where you can improvise, baking requires exact measurements and a deep understanding of chemistry, just like fine-tuning machine learning models for optimal performance.\nSome of my favorite things to make: 🥘 Cooking: Mediterranean & Middle Eastern dishes, Thai curries, homemade dumplings 🍰 Baking: Cinnamon rolls, cheesecakes, artisan bread\nFinance & Investing I’ve always been fascinated by finance and investing, and over the years, I’ve taken a personal interest in learning about markets, financial planning, and wealth-building strategies. I actively follow market trends, invest in stocks, ETFs, and GICs, and constantly look for ways to grow my financial literacy.\nWhat I love most about investing is how it mirrors data science—it’s all about analyzing trends, making data-driven decisions, and optimizing strategies for long-term gains. I enjoy breaking down financial concepts, tracking market performance, and making informed investment choices based on data and economic indicators.\nSome areas I focus on: 📈 Stock Market Analysis – Tracking and understanding stock trends 🏠 Real Estate Investing – Exploring investment properties and passive income strategies 📊 Portfolio Optimization – Balancing risk vs. return using data-driven decisions 💳 Personal Finance – Budgeting, saving, and maximizing financial opportunities\nI believe financial literacy is one of the most important skills to develop, and I enjoy sharing what I’ve learned with others.\nBadminton Badminton has been one of my favorite ways to stay active, competitive, and challenge myself. I love how the sport requires agility, quick decision-making, and strategy, making it a perfect combination of physical and mental engagement.\nI play regularly with friends and enjoy both singles and doubles matches. One of the things I love most about the sport is its fast-paced nature, which keeps me sharp and constantly improving my reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and endurance.\n🏆 What I’ve gained from badminton: ✔ Strategic thinking – Every shot requires precision and planning, much like structuring a data science project. ✔ Endurance & agility – Quick reactions and adaptability are key—similar to troubleshooting errors in coding! ✔ Competitive mindset – I love pushing myself to improve my skills and strategies with every game.\nI’d love to play more tournaments in the future and continue refining my skills on the court!"
