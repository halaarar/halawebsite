## Overview

The NYPD Arrest Tracker App is a collaborative data science project aimed at providing NYC government executives with a unified dashboard for monitoring arrest statistics** across the city. 

The goal of this project was to create an interactive and data-driven tool that allows policymakers to track trends, analyze arrest data, and make evidence-based decisions regarding law enforcement and public safety initiatives.

Collaborators:  Michael Gelfand, Michael Hewlett

## Technical Implementation

- Designing a responsive sidebar with custom filters for crime type, precinct vs. borough, and date ranges
- Creating the calendar-based date selector to allow time-based analysis
- Improving dashboard performance with function caching using `Flask-Caching`
- Cleaning and transforming geographic and demographic datasets using `pandas` and `GeoPandas`
- Coordinating version control with GitHub issues, branches, and pull requests
- Writing documentation including the final README and setup instructions

## Key Takeaways & Impact
Through this project, I gained experience in:

- Data Engineering – Processing large-scale NYC arrest records.
- Data Visualization – Developing interactive dashboards for government use.
- Policy Analytics – Using data science to drive public safety decisions.
- Public Sector UI/UX – Creating user-friendly tools for non-technical stakeholders.

This project highlights the real-world impact of data science in law enforcement and public policy.
