## **Overview**


Health Science Calculator is a Python package designed to provide accurate and efficient health metric calculations. This project was developed as part of a collaborative effort using best practices in software engineering, automation, and version control to ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability. This package was designed to be useful for health professionals, researchers, and fitness enthusiasts.

Collaborators: Akosua, Jiayi Li, Tengwei Wang

## Project Goals & Contributions

- Developed a modular Python package for health-related calculations.
- Implemented core functions for BMI, BMR, TDEE, and unit conversion.
- Integrated Pytest for automated testing, achieving 100% test coverage.
- Implemented GitHub Actions for CI/CD, enabling automated testing and deployment.
- Published the package to PyPI (`pip install healthsciencecalculator`).
- Designed API documentation using Sphinx and Read the Docs.
- Collaborated using Git workflows (branching, merging, pull requests).

## Technical Implementation  

This package includes the following key functions:  

- `get_tdee()`: Calculates Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) based on BMR and activity level.  
- `get_bmi()`: Computes Body Mass Index (BMI) and classifies users (underweight, normal, overweight, obese). 
- `get_bmr()`: Uses the Harris-Benedict equation to compute Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).  
- `unit_convert()`: Converts between metric and imperial units for weight, height, temperature, and volume.  


Each function was carefully tested to ensure accuracy and reliability.
