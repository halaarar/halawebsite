I worked as a dental assistent at Park Street Dentsitry. It was an amazing experience! I got to be at the forefront of care. I met indivduals from different walks of life. Addicts recovering from a drug addiction trying to turn their life around by taking out rotten teeth destroyed from years of drug abuse where I was able to emotionally assist by talking through the proccess and calming them down. to young syrian refugee families that have never seen a health care proffesional who I had to translate for because they couldn’t speak english. I developed several skills like care taking, empathy patience, and team work. Additionally, I was able to see all the behind the scenes action that most people don’t get to see and the hard work that all the assistants and technicians do that goes unnoticed. I learned about the importance of cleanlines and blah blah in health care. These are skills that I can bring into the tech field."

Not only did I teach others how to fish, but I also managed to catch the biggest fish in the pond that season!\n📸 Photo of my biggest catch!\nThis experience taught me resilience, patience, and adaptability—qualities that I now apply in problem-solving and tackling complex challenges in data science.\nCooking & Baking Cooking has always been more than just a necessity for me—it’s a creative outlet and a way to unwind. I love experimenting with new recipes, different cuisines, and unique flavor combinations. Whether it’s perfecting a classic homemade pasta dish, trying my hand at Middle Eastern desserts, or recreating my grandmother’s traditional recipes, I find joy in the process of creating something from scratch.\nBaking, on the other hand, has taught me precision and patience—qualities that also translate well into data science and programming. Unlike cooking, where you can improvise, baking requires exact measurements and a deep understanding of chemistry, just like fine-tuning machine learning models for optimal performance.\nSome of my favorite things to make: 🥘 Cooking: Mediterranean & Middle Eastern dishes, Thai curries, homemade dumplings 🍰 Baking: Cinnamon rolls, cheesecakes, artisan bread\nFinance & Investing I’ve always been fascinated by finance and investing, and over the years, I’ve taken a personal interest in learning about markets, financial planning, and wealth-building strategies. I actively follow market trends, invest in stocks, ETFs, and GICs, and constantly look for ways to grow my financial literacy.\nWhat I love most about investing is how it mirrors data science—it’s all about analyzing trends, making data-driven decisions, and optimizing strategies for long-term gains. I enjoy breaking down financial concepts, tracking market performance, and making informed investment choices based on data and economic indicators.\nSome areas I focus on: 📈 Stock Market Analysis – Tracking and understanding stock trends 🏠 Real Estate Investing – Exploring investment properties and passive income strategies 📊 Portfolio Optimization – Balancing risk vs. return using data-driven decisions 💳 Personal Finance – Budgeting, saving, and maximizing financial opportunities\nI believe financial literacy is one of the most important skills to develop, and I enjoy sharing what I’ve learned with others.\nBadminton Badminton has been one of my favorite ways to stay active, competitive, and challenge myself. I love how the sport requires agility, quick decision-making, and strategy, making it a perfect combination of physical and mental engagement.\nI play regularly with friends and enjoy both singles and doubles matches. One of the things I love most about the sport is its fast-paced nature, which keeps me sharp and constantly improving my reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and endurance.\n🏆 What I’ve gained from badminton: ✔ Strategic thinking – Every shot requires precision and planning, much like structuring a data science project. ✔ Endurance & agility – Quick reactions and adaptability are key—similar to troubleshooting errors in coding! ✔ Competitive mindset – I love pushing myself to improve my skills and strategies with every game.\nI’d love to play more tournaments in the future and continue refining my skills on the court!"

Deploy to PyPI: If all tests pass, the package is automatically updated on PyPI. 💡 Impact: CI/CD ensures code quality, early bug detection, and smooth integration into production.\n3️⃣ Automated Testing with Pytest Testing is crucial in health applications, so I implemented comprehensive unit tests using Pytest:\n✔ Validated all health metric calculations against known industry standards. ✔ Implemented edge-case handling (e.g., division by zero, incorrect input types). ✔ Ran parameterized tests to ensure correctness across various inputs. ✔ Tracked test coverage using pytest-cov, achieving 100% test coverage.\n💡 Testing Commands:\nbash Copy Edit # Run all tests pytest"
