## Overview

The Bank Marketing Prediction collaborative Project applies machine learning techniques to enhance bank marketing strategies by predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and campaign-related data.

The goal was to develop a predictive model that helps banks:

- **Optimize resource allocation**  
- **Minimize marketing costs**  
- **Improve customer conversion rates**

This project incorporated end-to-end data science workflows, data preprocessing, and model evaluation to identify the most effective approach for targeted marketing.

Collaborators: Fazeeia Mohammad, Rong Wan

## Project Goals & Contributions

This project focused on **developing a scalable and automated machine learning workflow** to improve marketing strategies. The main objectives and contributions include:

- **Predicting Customer Subscription Behavior**: Building predictive models to classify customer responses based on demographic and campaign-related data.  
- **Optimizing Marketing Strategies**: Identifying patterns in customer responses to enhance targeting and reduce marketing costs.  
- **Building a Fully Reproducible Machine Learning Pipeline**: Developing an end-to-end pipeline using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and GitHub Actions.  
- **Automating Data Processing & Model Training**: Implementing a structured workflow using **Click, Docker, and Makefiles** to ensure automation.  
- **Enhancing Model Interpretability**: Using feature importance analysis to provide insights into the key factors influencing customer behavior.   
- **Effectively Communicating Insights**: Presenting findings through structured reports and **data-driven presentations** to stakeholders.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Cleaned, standardized, and structured raw customer data.  
- Applied feature scaling and categorical encoding.  
- Handled missing values and class imbalance issues to improve model performance.  

### Machine Learning Models & Performance Evaluation
- Built **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier** models.  
- Tuned hyperparameters to improve precision, recall, and overall accuracy.  
- Compared models based on **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score**.  
- Identified trade-offs between false positives and false negatives for better marketing decisions.  

### Automating Workflows with Docker & Makefile
- Dockerized the project for reproducibility and easy deployment.  
- Used Makefiles to automate data processing, model training, and reporting.  

### Running the Analysis
- Set up a **Docker container** to allow for easy execution of the project.  
- Automated data processing and model training using **Makefile** workflows.  
- Generated structured reports detailing model performance and business recommendations.

## Presenting the Findings
To ensure **stakeholders could easily interpret and apply model insights**, we developed a **presentation** that:  

- Simplified complex machine learning concepts.
- Highlighted the most impactful findings from model evaluation.  
- Provided **clear, data-driven recommendations** to enhance marketing strategies.  

By combining **technical depth with actionable insights**, this presentation helped decision-makers understand **how AI-driven marketing could improve customer outreach and conversion rates**.
